## My process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS Grid (In a different branch)
- Flexbox
### Continued development

It's fun to go back to the basics of HTML/CSS. Even if it's not perfect and the development was quite straightforward, I think I managed to learn something new and I want to keep going with this.
